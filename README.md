A machine learning app that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) using Logistic Regression on the MNIST digits dataset.  
Built as part of a university AI course project to gain hands-on experience with foundational machine learning workflows.





##  About the Project

This project was completed as part of **COMP 472 – Artificial Intelligence** at **Concordia University (Summer 2025)**.  
The goal was to build a basic digit classifier using Python and get familiar with popular machine learning libraries like **NumPy** and **scikit-learn**.

##  What It Does

- Loads and visualizes handwritten digit images from the MNIST dataset
- Normalizes and splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluates model accuracy using classification metrics and confusion matrix
- Saves visual and evaluation outputs

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **scikit-learn**

##  How to Run

```bash
cd mnist-digit-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
python digit_classifier.py
